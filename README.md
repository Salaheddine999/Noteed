# Noteed

Noteed is a free minimal app that helps you write and manage your thoughts or todo lists.

Give it a try:

## Tech Stack

I used React and Daisy UI (Tailwind CSS component library) on the frontend. And for the backend I used 'xano' to create database to store notes,
and to generate RESTful API. And to integrate the backend with the frontend I used React-Query. I also used Auth0 to add authentication and authorization services to the app.


### Installation

Install the npm packages:

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

And then run the app locally:

```
$ npm start
```
