# Noteed

Noteed is a free minimal app that helps you write and manage your thoughts or todo lists, with the ability to access your notes from different devices.

I've used Vercel for the deployment. Give it a try: https://noteed-lime.vercel.app/

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: React, React Query, React Router, Tailwind CSS (Daisy UI).
- Back-end: Xano to store notes, and generate RESTful APIs.
- Authentication: Auth0.
